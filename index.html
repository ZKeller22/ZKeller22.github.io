    <p>My name is Zane Keller and I am currently a Business Analyst for First Foundation Advisors. I have a passion for data management and being on the cutting edge of technology that will remove manual work form an organization and allow for process streamlining.</p>

    <p>I took this databootcamp course to sharpen my skills in programming and get outside my comfort zone.</p>
